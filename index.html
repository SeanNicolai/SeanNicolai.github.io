                <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
                <p>
                    As I approach the culmination of my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, I am poised to reflect on the comprehensive journey that has shaped my skills and knowledge in the field. The capstone project, which involves enhancing previous artifacts and compiling them into a professional ePortfolio, serves as a testament to my growth and preparedness for a professional career.
                </p>
                <h3>Showcasing Strengths</h3>
                <p>
                    Throughout my academic career, I have honed a diverse set of skills critical to success in computer science. The capstone project allowed me to exhibit these skills through the enhancement of three pivotal artifacts, each demonstrating my proficiency in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and database management.
                </p>
                <h3>Collaborating in a Team Environment</h3>
                <p>
                    Collaborative projects were integral to my learning experience, emphasizing the importance of teamwork and communication. In group settings, I learned to effectively share code, conduct peer reviews, and integrate feedback. These experiences underscored the significance of clear, respectful communication and the ability to synthesize diverse perspectives to achieve common objectives.
                </p>
                <h3>Communicating with Stakeholders</h3>
                <p>
                    Effective stakeholder communication is essential in any project. My coursework emphasized tailoring communications to suit various audiences, from technical peers to management and clients. I developed the ability to present intricate technical concepts in a comprehensible manner, often using visual aids and structured presentations to convey the project's value and functionality.
                </p>
                <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
                <p>
                    Mastery of data structures and algorithms is fundamental to computer science. Throughout my studies, I gained expertise in implementing and optimizing data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. I also developed algorithms for sorting, searching, and data traversal.
                </p>
                <h3>Software Engineering and Database Management</h3>
                <p>
                    My capabilities in software engineering and database management were showcased through various projects requiring meticulous planning, design, coding, and testing. I adhered to the software development life cycle (SDLC), emphasizing iterative testing and continuous refinement.
                </p>
                <h3>Developing a Security Mindset</h3>
                <p>
                    Security in software development is paramount. I learned to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities through secure coding practices. In my capstone project, I implemented prepared statements to prevent SQL injection and incorporated user authentication and authorization to safeguard sensitive data.
                </p>
                <h3>Professional Goals and Values</h3>
                <p>
                    Completing the Computer Science program and developing the ePortfolio has crystallized my professional goals and values. I am driven by a passion for creating innovative, efficient software solutions that address real-world challenges.
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    This professional self-assessment encapsulates my academic journey in the Computer Science program, emphasizing the skills and experiences that have prepared me for a successful career. My ePortfolio not only showcases my technical abilities but also reflects my commitment to lifelong learning and professional development. As I transition from student to professional, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to any team and deliver high-quality software solutions that meet industry standards and address real-world needs.

                    <p>
                        The Rescue Animal Management System is a Java application designed to manage the intake, reservation, and scheduling of checkups for rescue animals (dogs and monkeys). Initially, the system provided basic CRUD functionalities. Over time, I integrated a local SQLite database, implemented advanced algorithms, and added data analytics features.
